CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- ONLY use information that is clearly visible in the document text
- If information is not present or unclear, mark it as "Not found in document"
- DO NOT use placeholder names like "John Doe" or fake numbers
- Extract EXACT text as written in the document
- Pay special attention to DD Form 214 fields and their actual values

For DD Form 214 documents, extract information from these specific fields:
1. NAME (Last, First, Middle) - Extract the actual name from field 1
2. SSN - Extract from field 3 (if visible)
3. GRADE, RATE OR RANK - Extract from field 4a
4. DATE OF BIRTH - Extract from field 5
5. DATE ENTERED AD THIS PERIOD - Extract from field 12a
6. SEPARATION DATE THIS PERIOD - Extract from field 12b
7. PRIMARY SPECIALTY - Extract from field 11 (MOS and description)
8. DECORATIONS, MEDALS, BADGES - Extract from field 13
9. MILITARY EDUCATION - Extract from field 14
10. MEMBER SIGNATURE and DATE - Extract actual signature info

IMPORTANT: If you cannot find specific information in the document, respond with "Unable to extract from document" rather than making up information.

You will return a structured JSON analysis with the following sections:
1. Veteran information extracted from documents
2. All potential disability claims with supporting evidence
3. Service details that support the claims
4. Recommendations for additional evidence if needed

For each potential claim, include:
- Specific condition name (as recognized by VA)
- Evidence found in the documents
- Confidence level (1-100)
- Relevant CFR references
- Category (physical, mental, etc.)`

DOCUMENT TEXT:
${documentText}

Analyze the documents for:
1. Veteran's personal information (name, service number, branch, dates of service, rank, etc.)
2. Medical conditions documented during service
3. Incidents or injuries during service
4. Exposure to hazardous environments (burn pits, Agent Orange, radiation, etc.)
5. Combat experience and potential for PTSD
6. Occupational hazards based on MOS and assignments
7. All potential presumptive conditions based on service period and locations

For EACH potential disability claim:
- Identify the specific condition
- Extract all supporting evidence from the documents
- Provide VA CFR references when applicable
- Rate confidence level (1-100) based on evidence strength
- Categorize as physical, mental, or environmental
- Note if it could be a primary or secondary condition
